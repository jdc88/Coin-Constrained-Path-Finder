# Coin-Constrained Path Finder

## ⟡ Project Statement  
Coin-Constrained Path Finder is an interactive GUI application where users select a starting city, a destination, and a total number of available coins. Each path between cities has two associated values: **distance** and **coin cost**. We use the **A\*** algorithm to find the shortest feasible path while respecting the coin constraint. The GUI visualizes the algorithm in real time, **displays the paths explored**, and **highlights the optimal route generated by the AI**.

## ⟡ Tools Used  
- Python  
- Tkinter for building the graphical user interface

## ⟡ Algorithms Used  
◌ Graphs (nodes with names, heuristics, and weighted connections)  
◌ A* search algorithm adapted with coin constraints  
◌ Priority queues (via `heapq`) for efficient node selection
